INDIA is miles apart from FINLAND. There are a lot of differences in the culture, climate, cost of living between these two countries. Inspite of all these differences, we do hear bollywood beats and yoga in FINLAND that brings these two cultures together. We from AREENA COLLECTIONS met a few amazing personalities from this “world’s happiest country”, who strives to uphold this value of togetherness.

<h2>
Fusion
</h2>

<p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:160%;" >

We all wanna stand out from the crowd. Be it the kind of work we do, food recipes we make or the way we deal with people, difference always draws attention. In today’s drastically changing society, we tend to get applauded more for the uniqueness in the things we do than for excellence. That is where the relevance of fusion comes from. Fusion is today’s trend. Nobody wants to listen to the cover of Closer by Chainsmokers  or Lean on by Major Lazor and DJ Snake which feels exactly like listening to the original, but mix it with a hindi and a Punjabi song kabira and jind mahi and together you get a 50 million view (Vidya Voxx). This trend is not restricted to music alone. It is everywhere. It is in food, technology and even in fashion. Wearing a salwar kamees is a common site in India. But wearing a crop top along with it makes it really unique and will certainly attract attention. Here we see an Indo-western fusion. In an increasingly globalising world were many earlier feared the loss of one’s culture and  ethnic variety, we now see a positive trend of growing fusion between many cultures. This is where the scope for Indian and Finland  clothing’s fusion becomes really apparent. Areena Collections is here just to provide you that. Here there are hundreds of collections which really highlight the unique cultural varieties of Finland and India.
